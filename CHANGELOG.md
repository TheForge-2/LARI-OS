This file will keep track of all publicly released versions of LARI OS, listing all their additions, changes and fixes from the previous one. Only the stable versions found on the `master` branch will appear in the following list, in reverse chronological order.

Commits from `dev` or other development branches will not be tracked in the changelog, so this file will only be updated to the `master` version they are based on.

## InDev 0.0 - 2025/06/05

First public version of LARI OS.
This initial build features a real mode CLI shell, booted by a single-sector bootloader, alongside 3 working basic commands (`hello`, `help`, `poweroff`).

It marks the starting point for all future development of this operating system, being the first ever version to be tracked on Git and hosted on GitHub.
